# 🚀 0G DA Node Deployment Guide | by Yusril
Welcome to my 0G Node Deployment Documentation.  
This repository contains a detailed guide on how I set up and optimized a node for the 0G DA NODE blockchain testnet, aimed at supporting decentralization and maximizing potential airdrop opportunities.
## 🌐 About 0G Blockchain

0G (ZeroGravity) is a next-generation modular blockchain focusing on scalability, data availability, and decentralized compute infrastructure. Running a node on 0G empowers the network and rewards early adopters.
This repository contains scripts and documentation to deploy and manage a **0G Data Availability Node**.
