# 0G Data Availability Node Architecture

The 0G Data Availability Node is designed to ensure that the data availability layer of the blockchain is maintained by running multiple nodes on decentralized infrastructure. Below are the key components:

## Components
1. **Docker**: The node runs inside a Docker container to isolate dependencies and environments.
2. **Node Software**: The node software handles data requests, block validation, and synchronizing with the blockchain.
3. **Networking**: The node communicates with other nodes in the network over a secure and high-speed connection.
4. **Storage**: The node stores blockchain data on an NVMe SSD to ensure fast access and reliability.
